With over 50 internal Adobe stakeholders, we're going to be following a radical approach of collaboration–come build with us!

We want to empower Adobe stakeholders by:
 * [Roadmap](#project-roadmap)–we set the overall goals to support stakeholders based on research
 * [Rituals](#project-rituals)–we maintain a regular cadence of project activities that all internal stakeholders are welcome to join
 * [Agency](#stakeholder-agency)–our goal is to put the power to evolve and publish in the hands of all internal stakeholders
